// There are 8 basic data types in JavaScript.

// Seven primitive data types:

// number for numbers of any kind: integer or floating-point, integers are limited by ±(253-1).

// bigint for integer numbers of arbitrary length.

// string for strings. A string may have zero or more characters, there’s no separate single-character type.

// boolean for true/false.

// null for unknown values – a standalone type that has a single value null.

// undefined for unassigned values – a standalone type that has a single value undefined.

// symbol for unique identifiers.

// And one non-primitive data type:

// object for more complex data structures.

// The typeof operator allows us to see which type is stored in a variable.

// Usually used as typeof x, but typeof(x) is also possible.

// Returns a string with the name of the type, like "string".

// For null returns "object" – this is an error in the language, it’s not actually an object.
